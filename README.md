# DummyProducts
A simple app used to view list of products.

# Description
User can check the details of the product by clicking on any item from the list. Also, user can add that specific item inside the cart and can see the cart list.

# Architecture
This application is built in MVVM architecture and have used nav component for navigation. For API calling I have used Retrofit and for data persistance I have used Room Database. For dependency injection I have used dagger-hilt. The application is built on single activity which has further multiple fragments. 

# Unit Tests
I have implemented Room Dao Unit test cases using JUnit.

# Challenges
I have faced challenges while writing test cases for the app. Moreover, while implementing dagger-hilt there were so many challenges I have faced but somehow I have tackled all of them.

# How To Run
Just clone or download the project and run it in your device. The app will start to run.
